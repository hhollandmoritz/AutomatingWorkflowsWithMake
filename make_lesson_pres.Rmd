# Overview 
## Resources/Links/Inspiration:
Today's presentation is heavily inspired by:

1. Sofware Carpentry's lesson in makefile
   - [https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/](https://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice)

## Today's Topics
1. Introduction to Make
2. 

# Introduction to `make` 

## **Why should we be using makefiles?**

1. Reproducible workflows with minimal brain power

## ** Anatomy of a makefile**

```{make test make file}
# Count words.
